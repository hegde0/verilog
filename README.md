# verilog
Some experiments to get hands on experience with Nexys A7 FPGA development board using verilog. UART  and 7 segment LED display projects utilises on board peripherals. [IPcores](https://github.com/hegde0/verilog/tree/main/ipcores) contains implementations of 8-bit ALU, ring-johnson counter and an updown counter exported as IPcores using Vivado.
